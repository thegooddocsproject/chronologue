        <h3>How to join</h3>
        <p>
          Our project is organized into small working groups of about 2-10
          people who collaborate together to work on key project
          initiatives and tasks. For that reason, one of the best ways you
          can get started is to look at our list of working groups and
          decide which groups you might want to join and contribute to.
